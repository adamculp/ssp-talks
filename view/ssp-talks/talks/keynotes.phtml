            Imagine a world in which your career, the careers of your friends and coworkers, and the businesses and industries built on PHP vanished overnight, or never existed at all. No Facebook. No Wordpress. Billions of dollars in online commerce, all gone. Flickr, Tumblr, MailChimp: poof!<br /><br />

            This talk presents a dystopian world in which we are stuck updating each other via SMS or (gasp!) MySpace, reading content on corporate portals, and buying everything from just a handful of online marketplaces.<br /><br />

            Ever wondered what it entails to contribute back to an open source project? Do you monkey patch libraries then watch in horror as everything breaks when you do a composer update? Have you really thought about giving something back, but no idea where to start?<br /><br />

            How hard can it be?<br /><br />

            Let's pick an issue on an open source project, right off GitHub, and work together through each step until we've submitted a fully working and (hopefully) soon-to-be-accepted pull request.<br /><br />

            In 1969, researchers at Stanford and UCLA collaborated to transmit the first message over what would become the Internet. In just five decades, the repercussions of that moment have echoed through every atom of society. The world is evolving at a pace unprecedented in human history as we use technology to change how we think, learn, communicate, and even how we understand ourselves. Let’s take an inside look at how the fusion of media and technology is reinventing human interaction and the role that we, as engineers and technologists, must play in this important process.<br /><br />
