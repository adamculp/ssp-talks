            <h2>A World Without PHP</h2>

            Imagine a world in which your career, the careers of your friends and coworkers, and the businesses and industries built on PHP vanished overnight, or never existed at all. No Facebook. No Wordpress. Billions of dollars in online commerce, all gone. Flickr, Tumblr, MailChimp: poof!<br /><br />

            This talk presents a dystopian world in which we are stuck updating each other via SMS or (gasp!) MySpace, reading content on corporate portals, and buying everything from just a handful of online marketplaces.<br /><br />

            10 years ago I was a lonely developer sitting in a small room quietly turning out code between 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday. Fast-forward to now and you'll see me standing in front of audiences all around the world talking to developers about numerous topics."Why are you bragging like that at me?" I hear you ask. Because it could happen to you too.<br /><br />

            The question I always ask myself is "How the hell did that happen?!?!".<br /><br />

            The truth is that the only reason I've managed to advance my career so far in a decade is because of the people that make up the communities of open source projects. Not only do open source projects save you time and money, but the friendships and support groups that can be made within these communities is, frankly, staggering.<br /><br />

            Join me as I chart my journey from wage slave to conference speaker, and look at how you can leverage the power of open source to make real friends, real money, and real happiness.<br /><br />

            In 1969, researchers at Stanford and UCLA collaborated to transmit the first message over what would become the Internet. In just five decades, the repercussions of that moment have echoed through every atom of society. The world is evolving at a pace unprecedented in human history as we use technology to change how we think, learn, communicate, and even how we understand ourselves. Let’s take an inside look at how the fusion of media and technology is reinventing human interaction and the role that we, as engineers and technologists, must play in this important process.<br /><br />
