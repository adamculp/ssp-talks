            Nicolas speaks about accessibility for people with disabilities, the current efforts by so many projects and conferences to include diversity, and how the term "accessibility" can create an "us vs them" mindset that doesn't benefit anyone. Using his experience working with people with disabilities and working on several FOSS projects and anecdotes, He'll paint a picture of where we've been, where we're at, and what the future may look like. <br /><br />

            Technology is everything these days, and your skills as a developer are in high demand. How can you leverage your unique skill set and understanding of technology to climb the ranks in your company beyond “just a developer?” Ann will tell her story of going from underpaid full-time developer, to broke freelancer, to entrepreneur, and finally to partner and CTO. More importantly, she’ll tell you what she learned along the way about the art of persuasion, transparency as a trojan horse, indispensability, confidence, standing your ground, and ultimately how to be treated and respected as a leader and not an employee. Disclaimer: I cannot confirm or deny that I have a problem with authority and a thirst for power.<br /><br />
