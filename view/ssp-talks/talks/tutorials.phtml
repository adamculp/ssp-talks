            <h2>Building Modern APIs in Expressive</h2>

            <br /><br />

            Modern applications increasingly require an API, whether to support rich client-side experiences, mobile apps, or to integrate with other systems, and PHP is evolving to be an excellent tool for this job. This tutorial will cover the fundamentals of building a really excellent and robust API in PHP including how to handle media types, authentication and errors appropriately. We'll use Expressive since it uses the PSR-7 HTTP message interfaces, includes routing and a dependency injection container, and combined with its elegant middleware patterns it makes a very lightweight but solid foundation for our project. During the session you will build your own simple, working API and gain the skills that you can take back to the office to implement APIs of all kinds.<br /><br />

            <br /><br />

            In this tutorial we start by defining an API with Apigility as our main engine, we will define all the details to make sure we set up our API so it can be consumed by our web application and our mobile application.<br /><br />

            We continue by creating a web application that will consume the API resources and how to define the flow from data consumption to views using Zend Framework.<br /><br />

            Then we will define a simple mobile app, which will consume the services from our API. For this we will use Sencha Touch. We will learn about the details to promote our App to the App store and Google play.<br /><br />

            Ensuring software reliability, resiliency, and recoverability is best achieved by practicing effective defensive coding. Take a crash course in defensive coding with PHP and learn about attack surfaces, input validation, canonicalization, secure type checking, external library vetting, cryptographic agility, exception management, code reviews, and unit and behavioral testing. Learn some helpful tips and tricks from experienced professionals within the PHP community as we review the latest blogs and discussions on best practices to defend your project.<br /><br />

            <br /><br />

            Symfony 4 is out! And it's the best Symfony ever! Faster! Re-imagined developer experience! And easier to create the feature you need! In this workshop, we'll bootstrap a new Symfony app and learn about Symfony Flex: the secret behind the fact that Symfony automatically scales from a "microframework" to a "macroframework" as your app grows. We'll also leverage the new dependency injection features that will let us build the same high-quality features in a fraction of the time and code. Let's rock!<br /><br />

            An accessible website opens the door for millions more people to engage in your site content. In many cases, it is also a legal requirement. Learn testing techniques to check your website for ADA, Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 compliance. During this workshop you will hone your manual testing skills as well as learn about automated testing tools.<br /><br />

            In this workshop we'll cover different ways to test your PHP code. Our focus will be the tools and writing tests - we won't get caught up in all the testing dogma. Instead, we'll create a foundation in tools like PHPUnit, Mockery, and Codeception so you can make the decisions about what testing tools and strategies work best for you and your code. So if you're looking to start testing your PHP code, or learn other PHP testing tools, this workshop is for you.<br /><br />
