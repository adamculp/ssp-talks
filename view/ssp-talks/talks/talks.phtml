        Below is a full listing of 50 minute talks to be presented at SunshinePHP. Our selection committee did a wonderful job of selecting a nice variety of talk topics by some of the best speakers.  We hope there is something for everyone developing with PHP.<br /><br />
    
        NOTE: Attending these 50 minute talks on Friday and Saturday February 5th and 6th requires the purchase of a normal conference ticket on the <a href="http://sunshinephp.com/register" title="Speaker: SunshinePHP Registration">Registration page</a>.
